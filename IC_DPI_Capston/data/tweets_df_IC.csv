Is there anything else that could negatively impact the yield?

In times of high market volatility, icETH’s smart contracts can trigger some automated deleveraging to protect against catastrophic loss of funds.

Short-term negative APYs are also possible.",indexcoop

Input your wallet address, and we’ll calculate your personalized icETH yield:

Deviation from NAV, differences between the prices of stETH &amp;  ETH, &amp; the leverage ratio all push the current price of icETH lower.",indexcoop

The upcoming @ethereum  Shanghai upgrade will allow for withdrawals of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.

Once the upgrade is complete experts expect that stETH and ETH will trade at par.

2022-11-24 13:41:39+00:00,1595774652722417664,"6/18

Why is the price of icETH sometimes less than ETH?

The market volatility in 2022 has created a short-term price differential between stETH and ETH, where stETH is worth less than ETH. 

Since icETH’s underlying holding is stETH, the price of $icETH is also impacted. https://t.co/Y0qRO87Aer",indexcoop
2022-11-24 13:41:38+00:00,1595774647555223553,"5/18 

How does $icETH's yield accrue?

The yield denominated in $stETH auto-compounds and accrues to the position in @AaveAave, and this gain in yield is reflected in the price of the icETH token. 

Over time, the value of icETH should be greater than stETH &amp; ETH. https://t.co/1LBh0pVbNb",indexcoop
2022-11-24 13:41:37+00:00,1595774642249162753,"4/18 

How does $icETH work?

icETH deposits stETH into @AaveAave. Then wETH is borrowed on Aave until it reaches the desired multiple. 

Next, the loaned wETH &amp; the user’s initial deposit are exchanged for stETH. The total stETH, minus the fee, is deposited back into the Aave. https://t.co/PKS1AJDVUC",indexcoop
2022-11-24 13:41:36+00:00,1595774639011135493,"3/18

Where does the yield come from?

icETH enhances ETH staking rewards via an automated leveraged liquid strategy. 

The composability of @LidoFinance's $stETH &amp; @AaveAave makes it possible for icETH to construct this yield strategy in an ERC-20 token.

https://t.co/xOTIEV7K6B",indexcoop
